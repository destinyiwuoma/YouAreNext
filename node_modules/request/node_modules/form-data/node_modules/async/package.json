  "readme": "# Async.js\n\nAsync is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions\nfor working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for\nuse with [node.js](http://nodejs.org), it can also be used directly in the\nbrowser. Also supports [component](https://github.com/component/component).\n\nAsync provides around 20 functions that include the usual 'functional'\nsuspects (map, reduce, filter, each…) as well as some common patterns\nfor asynchronous control flow (parallel, series, waterfall…). All these\nfunctions assume you follow the node.js convention of providing a single\ncallback as the last argument of your async function.\n\n\n## Quick Examples\n\n```javascript\nasync.map(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n\nasync.filter(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.exists, function(results){\n    // results now equals an array of the existing files\n});\n\nasync.parallel([\n    function(){ ... },\n    function(){ ... }\n], callback);\n\nasync.series([\n    function(){ ... },\n    function(){ ... }\n]);\n```\n\nThere are many more functions available so take a look at the docs below for a\nfull list. This module aims to be comprehensive, so if you feel anything is\nmissing please create a GitHub issue for it.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n### Binding a context to an iterator\n\nThis section is really about bind, not about async. If you are wondering how to\nmake async execute your iterators in a given context, or are confused as to why\na method of another library isn't working as an iterator, study this example:\n\n```js\n// Here is a simple object with an (unnecessarily roundabout) squaring method\nvar AsyncSquaringLibrary = {\n  squareExponent: 2,\n  square: function(number, callback){ \n    var result = Math.pow(number, this.squareExponent);\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      callback(null, result);\n    }, 200);\n  }\n};\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square, function(err, result){\n  // result is [NaN, NaN, NaN]\n  // This fails because the `this.squareExponent` expression in the square\n  // function is not evaluated in the context of AsyncSquaringLibrary, and is\n  // therefore undefined.\n});\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square.bind(AsyncSquaringLibrary), function(err, result){\n  // result is [1, 4, 9]\n  // With the help of bind we can attach a context to the iterator before\n  // passing it to async. Now the square function will be executed in its \n  // 'home' AsyncSquaringLibrary context and the value of `this.squareExponent`\n  // will be as expected.\n});\n```\n\n## Download\n\nThe source is available for download from\n[GitHub](http://github.com/caolan/async).\nAlternatively, you can install using Node Package Manager (npm):\n\n    npm install async\n\n__Development:__ [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async/raw/master/lib/async.js) - 29.6kb Uncompressed\n\n## In the Browser\n\nSo far it's been tested in IE6, IE7, IE8, FF3.6 and Chrome 5. Usage:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"async.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\n    async.map(data, asyncProcess, function(err, results){\n        alert(results);\n    });\n\n</script>\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Collectio
