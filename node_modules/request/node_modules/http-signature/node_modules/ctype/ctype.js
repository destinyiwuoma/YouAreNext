 * ctype.js
 *
 * This module provides a simple abstraction towards reading and writing
 * different types of binary data. It is designed to use ctio.js and provide a
 * richer and more expressive API on top of it.
 *
 * By default we support the following as built in basic types:
 *	int8_t
 *	int16_t
 *	int32_t
 *	uint8_t
 *	uint16_t
 *	uint32_t
 *	uint64_t
 *	float
 *	double
 *	char
 *	char[]
 *
 * Each type is returned as a Number, with the exception of char and char[]
 * which are returned as Node Buffers. A char is considered a uint8_t.
 *
 * Requests to read and write data are specified as an array of JSON objects.
 * This is also the same way that one declares structs. Even if just a single
 * value is requested, it must be done as a struct. The array order determines
 * the order that we try and read values. Each entry has the following format
 * with values marked with a * being optional.
 *
 * { key: { type: /type/, value*: /value/, offset*: /offset/ }
 *
 * If offset is defined, we lseek(offset, SEEK_SET) before reading the next
 * value. Value is defined when we're writing out data, otherwise it's ignored.
 *
