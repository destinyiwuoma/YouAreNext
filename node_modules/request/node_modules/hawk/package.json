Likewise, just as with the Digest scheme,\r\nthe key is never included in authenticated requests. Instead, it is used to calculate a request MAC value which is\r\nincluded in its place.\r\n\r\nHowever, **Hawk** has several differences from Digest. In particular, while both use a nonce to limit the possibility of\r\nreplay attacks, in **Hawk** the client generates the nonce and uses it in combination with a timestamp, leading to less\r\n\"chattiness\" (interaction with the server).\r\n\r\nAlso unlike Digest, this scheme is not intended to protect the key itself (the password in Digest) because\r\nthe client and server must both have access to the key material in the clear.\r\n\r\nThe primary design goals of this scheme are to:\r\n* simplify and improve HTTP authentication for services that are unwilling or unable to deploy TLS for all resources,\r\n* secure credentials
